Visualize geometric algorithms by using data structures that automatically draw themselves.
To implement a new algorithm:
	1. Create a new class in the algorithm package with a public method doAlgorithm() that executes the algorithm.
	2. Add the algorithm's name to the Algorithm enum.
	3. Implement its calling code in the ViewModel runAlgorithm method.
